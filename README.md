Lostrómos is a templating [operator](https://coreos.com/blog/introducing-operators.html).

*Please note that the documentation on Kubernetes Operators is somewhat out of date. [Third party resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/access-kubernetes-api/extend-api-third-party-resource/) have been deprecated, and operators now watch [Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/api-extension/custom-resources/).*

## Overview
### Problem Statement

Managing, sharing, and controlling an application's operational domain knowledge can be prone to human error and may create points of failure. Instead of maintaining lists, databases, and/or logic structures to control this information, Lostrómos automates maintenance of this information with only the need for a predefined template.

### How It Works

Lostrómos is a Kubernetes operator. It watches a Custom Resource (CR) endpoint. When a change is detected, it uses the information in the CR to fill a template. This template is applied either via [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl-overview/) or [Helm](https://docs.helm.sh/).

### Use Cases
*Control access to creation of Kubernetes resources*

As a Kubernetes admin, allow developers to create instances of an application for development purposes without giving them direct access to deploy to the production cluster. Developers can create a CR, and with Lostrómos, the instance is deployed with development specific operational parameters (such as a test database or a specific application package).

*Automate deployment of services alongside your application*

Deploy a Kubernetes application and an accompanying monitoring service that relies on operational data from that application (such as an IP address) by creating a single CR.

*Eliminate maintenance of application operational knowledge for deployments*

WP Engine uses Lostrómos in conjunction with another tool to customize VM deployments into GCE. Each VM instance offloads some of its workload to a separate Kubernetes application. As we create new VMs in GCE, this other tool monitors the Google API for these changes and creates a CR as they happen. Lostrómos watches for changes to this CR endpoint and creates a Helm release by combining information from the new CR and a predefined template. This allows us to deconstruct some of the work for our deployment into GCE and reduce maintenance work around sharing the data between applications.
